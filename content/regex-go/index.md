ðŸ¤— Say goodbye to tedious text processing tasks with Regex Go - your ultimate tool for seamless string manipulation using Regex and user-friendly RegexBuilder ðŸ¤©.

Regex Go utilized two powerful frameworks, Swift Regex and RegexBuilder, which were both introduced at WWDC22. Regular Expressions (regex) have been a popular text processing tool since the 1960s-1970s, enabling us to quickly search and match strings in text. However, using regex can be challenging due to its complex syntax and difficulty in reading and debugging.

At WWDC22, RegexBuilder was introduced as a DSL (domain-specific language) to construct regex in a more readable and maintainable manner. Regex Go's aim is to make it easier for individuals who are unfamiliar with Regex to use it. Users can easily drag and drop to promptly construct their own regex without having to learn the intricate syntax and rules. This will allow more individuals to appreciate the joy of coding and increase their work efficiency.
