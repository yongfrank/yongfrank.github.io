Smart Speaker powered by OpenAI, MS Azure, Picovoice.ai

![Smart Speaker](https://github.com/yongfrank/SmartSpeaker/raw/master/resources/screenshot.png?raw=true)

Based on the refined OpenAI models and extensive research on user needs, this project aimed to select a speech implementation framework that could meet the requirements of embedded systems.

We utilized Python Flask and React Socket.io to achieve seamless communication between the front-end web page and back-end server, visualizing GPT texts on the web page, and integrating Azure and OpenAI GPT models to accomplish speech recognition and synthesis.

![Run with Me Poster](https://github.com/yongfrank/RunWithMe/raw/firebase-development/RunWithMePoster_en_revised.jpeg)

To meet the needs of visually impaired individuals interested in running, I conducted interviews with the Beijing Blind Running Club and communicated with other members of the design and development team to determine the design needs and direction. Ultimately, I focused on improving the running experience for visually impaired runners by enhancing the fit between the runners and their guides during the development and design process.

After studying the developer documentation, I became familiar with the SDK. I utilized the gyroscope and accelerometer in the AirPods to evaluate the running posture of the visually impaired runners, thus improving their running experience and providing more effective advice. The app was designed in accordance with human interface guidelines and tailored to meet the needs of diverse users.

Our project participated in the selection of the Mobile Application Innovation Competition and won the Second Prize. During the competition, we had in-depth exchanges with other developers, designers, and judges, which broadened our thinking on mobile application development.

## [Blog Page - Based on Hugo, Power by GitHub Pages](https://yongfrank.github.io)

[![Blog Page](https://img.shields.io/badge/Blog_Page-yongfrank.github.io-success)](https://yongfrank.github.io/)

I consolidate and document relevant topics and issues encountered during my personal learning journey on my personal blog, which receives approximately 20 weekly views. This has enabled me to become proficient in website building and deployment processes, utilizing my knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, Docker, and other related technologies.
